# RTEMS Docker containers

Eases development and releasing of RTEMS applications by providing pre-built Docker images that contain all required dependencies, RTEMS, RTEMS Source Builder and built BSP for the builder, BSP and target of your choice.

[**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/bvobart/rtems)

---

Currently the only Dockerfile here is for the `sparc-rtems5` target with the `erc32` BSP, made by following the [Quick Start in the RTEMS User Manual](https://docs.rtems.org/branches/master/user/start/index.html). It took longer for the Docker container to build than to write the Dockerfile itself.
